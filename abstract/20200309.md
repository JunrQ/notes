# Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks for Object Tracking

## Abstract

* The problem of arbitrary object tracking has traditionally been tackled by learning a model of the object's apperance exclusively online, using as sole training data the video itself.
* Despite the success of these methods, their online-only approach inherently limits the richness of the model they can learn.
* Our tracker operates at frame-rates beyond real-time and, despite its extreme simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performace in multiple benchmarks.
* Several recent works have aimed to overcome this limitation using a pre-trained deep conv-net that was learnt for a different but related tasks.
