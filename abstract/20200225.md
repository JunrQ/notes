## Sentences

* The most popular features for pedestrian classification found in the literature are Haar wavelets, or extensions thereof, e.g.
* Their use is motivated by the fact that they encode loocal image features, i.e., intensity differences, at multiple scales, thus allowing for a balance between compactness and expressivity.
* Wavelets of the finest scale are assumed to represent noiose and are, hence, discarded, as well as very coarse scale wavelets which have support as large as the object itself.
* The hidden layer is divided into a number of branches, with all neurons within one branch sharing the same set of weights.
* We focused oour selection on pattern classifiers that directly construct the boundary, rather than density estimation approaches, given that the latter seem less suited for modeling the nontarget class, which is, in a sense, not a real class but coomprises the vast feature space of "everything else."
* This procedure is repeated until no further performance gain can be achieved.
